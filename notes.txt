TODOS : 

- save currentObject identifier
- point to resources (do not draw src each time)
- resources delete
- scale & rotate tool
- dynamic properties (text / button)
- save file name
- resources drag into object but do not replace image
- update transform, shadow, text according to selected object
- select align target
- canvas size
- zoom
- save toolboxes position, hidden / shown etc.
- image filters
- image resize
- animation
- tools should move to ui
- toolboxes should be upgraded to fit new toolbox object
- object fill color should allow selection from Solid, Gradient and Image


BUGS :

- exporting svg streched images showing original dimentions
- shadow offset in svg is not correct because of rotation
- dragging an image into the canvas when big image is not correct
- debug replaces text in view menu (objects)
- after canvas resize - image drop is wrong coordinates
- after canvas resize - clicking on layers renders wrong

FEATURES :

- grid before / after canvas ( change z-index and capture click on gridCanvas instead )

TODOS : 

- save currentObject identifier
- point to resources (do not draw src each time)
- scale & rotate tool
- save file name
- select align target
- zoom
- image filters
- image resize
- animation
- tools should move to ui
- object fill color should allow selection from Solid, Gradient and Image


BUGS :

- exporting svg streched images showing original dimentions
- shadow offset in svg is not correct because of rotation
- dragging an image into the canvas when big image is not correct
- debug replaces text in view menu (objects)
- after canvas resize - image drop is wrong coordinates
- after canvas resize - clicking on layers renders wrong

GROUPS TODOS :

- Dragging in objects toolbox is not ideal
- Currently using calc css method which is not supported in ie8
- renaming objects / groups not ideal
- coping objects within groups also copies the groups, not always wanted
- exporting svg groups


FEATURES :

- grid before / after canvas ( change z-index and capture click on gridCanvas instead )

CHANGELOG :
